# Blending_Motions_in_Unity

## Project Objective:
The primary objective of the project was to explore and implement seamless blending of skeletal animations in Unity. This involved creating a diverse set of animations, designing a motion tree for smooth transitions between idle, walk, and run motions, and assessing user interactions to enhance realism.

## Background Research:
These resources provided insights into the existing capabilities of Unity and best practices in skeletal animation, guiding the approach to the project:
- [Official Unity Documenttion to learn Unity's Animation System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationOverview.html)
- [Series of video tutorials from the iHeartDev YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwyUzJb_FNeTQwyGujWRLqnfKpV-cj-eO&feature=shared)

## Project Execution:
1. Selected Idel, Walk, Run animations from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/) - free and open platform with ready to use models for games and aniamation.
2. Constructed a motion tree for seamless blending between:
- Idle (No keyborad input needed)
- Walking ('W' pressed on keayboard)
- Runnning ('W' + 'Left Shift' pressed on keyboard)

animations using boolean parameters in AnimationControl Script through coding in C-sharp in Visual Studio.

2. Conducted a user assessment to evaluate the character's movements for smoothness and realism through interactive manipulation.

## Results:
- Successful implementation of a motion tree that allowed smooth transitions between Idle, Walk, and Run animations. (VIDEO LINK)
- Positive feedback from users in the assessment highlighted the realism achieved in character movements.

## Future Recommendations:
- **Expand Animation Set:** Introduce additional animations to further diversify the character's movements and responses.
- **Advanced Interaction Scenarios:** Explore and implement more complex user interaction scenarios, such as environmental responsiveness and interactive combat.

## Conclusion:
The successful implementation of seamless motion blending in Unity demonstrates that Unity is a great platform for advanced animation techniques. The positive user feedback underscores the project's success in achieving realistic character movements. Moving forward, the insights gained from this project will serve as a solid foundation for future endeavors in the realm of skeletal animation and character motion in Unity.
